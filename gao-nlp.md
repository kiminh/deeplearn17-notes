* brief introduction to the history of deep learning and its application to
  natural language processing (NLP) tasks
* deep learning technologies that are recently developed for three areas of NLP
  tasks.  
  1. semantic similarities between texts and images, the task that is
     fundamental to a wide range of applications, such as Web search ranking,
     recommendation, image captioning and machine translation. 
  2. a set of neural models developed for machine reading comprehension and
     question answering
  3. dialogue agents, including task-completion bots and social chat bots.
