* playing Atari games and Go. I will present several important algorithms
  including deep Q-Networks and asynchronous actor-critic algorithms (A3C),
  DDPG, SVG, guided policy search. I will discuss major challenges and
  promising results towards making deep reinforcement learning applicable to
  real world problems in robotics and natural language processing.
