* architectures will be reviewed
  * multi-layer perceptrons
  * sparse auto-encoders
  * restricted Boltzmann machines
  * convolutional neural networks. 
* applications in three categories, each characterized by the type of output
  into which the input image is transformed 
  1. Image to image transformation 
    * e.g., image denoising and colorization
  1. Image to mid-level representation 
    * e.g., image segmentation, contour detection
  1. Image to high-level representation 
    * e.g., image classification, object detection and face recognition
