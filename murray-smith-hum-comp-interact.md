* requires appropriate mathematical methods
* This tutorial will focus on the use of inference and dynamical modelling in
  human-computer interaction. The combination of modern statistical inference
  and real-time closed loop modelling offers rich possibilities in building
  interactive systems, but there is a significant gap between the techniques
  commonly used in HCI and the mathematical tools available in other fields of
  computing science. This tutorial aims to illustrate how to bring these
  mathematical tools to bear on interaction problems, and will cover basic
  theory and example 
* applications from: 
  * mobile interaction
  * interaction with large music collections. This will include work on the
    Bang & Olufsen Beomoment product and Syntonetic’s Moodgalaxy which combines
    Gaussian process priors, nonlinear dimensionality reduction and inferred
    moods to give you new ways to explore your music collection. I will also
    summarise some of our recent work on using the entropy of inferred mood and
    genre features to understand users’ criteria for playlist curation).
  * 3D human motion and 3D capacitive sensing systems. Future interactions will
    often be Casual interactions which are flowing ‘around device' or ‘over
    device’ interactions, potentially combined with speech recognition
    technologies, and look at the role of control theory and information theory
    in analysis of such systems. I will give examples where we have developed
    3D capacitive touch systems using particle filters and deep convolutional
    networks to infer finger pose and position above the surface of the device,
    and then created a series of ‘flow-based interactions’ which allow more
    carefree around device gesturing
