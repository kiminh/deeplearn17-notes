Marc’Aurelio Ranzato, FB AI Research Lab

* convolutional neural networks, and embeddings. The former is employed in
* audio and visual processing applications, while the latter is used for
* representing text, graphs and other discrete or symbolic data
* deal with sequential data, like videos. 
* Lectures will provide intuitions, the underlying mathematics, typical
* applications, code snippets and references
* attendees are expected to gain enough familiarity to be able to apply these
  basic tools to standard datasets on their own.

#Syllabus

##Session 1 - Deep Learning for Vision and Audio Processing Applications

* The basics: from logistic regression to fully connected neural networks, and
  from fully connected neural networks to convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
* Special layers used in vision applications.
* Example of CNNs using the pyTorch open source library.

##Session 2: - Deep Learning for Text Processing Applications.

* How neural networks can be adapted to work with discrete symbolic data like
  text: the concept of embedding.
* Methods using embeddings for a variety of text application tasks.
* Example of learning from text using pyTorch.

##Session 3: Deep Learning for Sequential Data.

* Learning from sequences: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).
* How to train and generate from RNNs, variants of RNNs.
* Examples of applications of RNNs using pyTorch.
