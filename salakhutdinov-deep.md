multi-layer hierarchies of representations, emphasizing their applications in
information retrieval, data mining, collaborative filtering, and computer
vision.

#Syllabus

The tutorial will be split into two parts.

1.  introduction into graphical models, neural networks, and deep learning
    models
    * Unsupervised learning methods, including autoencoders, restricted
      Boltzmann machines, and methods for learning over-complete
      representations.  
    * Supervised methods for deep models, including deep convolutional neural
      network models and their applications to text comprehension, data mining,
      image and video analysis.
2.  more advanced models, including Variational Autoencoders, Generative
    Adversarial Networks, Deep Boltzmann Machines, and Recurrent Neural
    Networks. We will also address mathematical issues, focusing on efficient
    large-scale optimization methods for inference and learning.  
* applications 
  * natural language processing, reading comprehension, multimodal learning,
    collaborative filtering, and image/video analysis.
