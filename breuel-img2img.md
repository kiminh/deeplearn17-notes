Segmentation, Processing, and Tracking, 
	with Applications to Video, Gaming, VR, and Self-driving Cars

#Summary
Image-to-Image Transformations, Semantic Segmentation, Mid-Level Vision

#Syllabus

The course will cover deep learning for image-to-image transformations

##application areas:

* self-driving cars
* inside-out tracking for VR/AR
* gesture recognition and analysis
* smart cameras
* video gaming
* robotics

## architectures and their applications to these domains:

* image filtering with deep learning
* image and video enhancement and coding with deep learning
* optical flow and motion segmentation
* texture detection, classification, and segmentation
* semantic image segmentation, including medical applications
* face and object detection and tracking
* modeling image degradation and style transfer
* training on synthetic data and model-based vision

The course will cover the major network architectures, training methods, and
data sets, as well as connections with classical image processing, statistics,
computer vision, and human vision.
