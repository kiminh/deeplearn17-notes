* flexibility in brainâ€™s processing hierarchy, including shortcuts, additional
levels, feedback signaling and interactions across different hierarchies that
have greatly impacted our understanding of how the brain can perform ultra-fast
object localization, learn new concepts by leveraging prior learning, and learn
in deep hierarchies.

#Syllabus

* Session 1: The basics: Vision in the brain: Feedforward, simple-to-complex
  hierarchies
* Session 2: New insights into deep hierarchies in brain: Deep, deeper and
  shallower processing; re-entrant signals for learning and conscious
  awareness.
* Session 3: Learning across modalities: From objects to words, audition, and
  touch
