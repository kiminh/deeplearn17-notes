* Can AI understand how players feel, think and react and, in turn,
automatically design new games for them? Can those computationally designed
games be considered creative? When does this happen and who judges after all?
How can Deep Learning help us achieve these goals?
* computer games as the ideal application domain for computational creativity,
  affective computing and machine (deep) learning for the unique features they
  offer. For that purpose, I will identify a number of key 
  * creative facets in modern game development and discuss their required
    orchestration for a final successful game product. I will also focus on the
  * player emotion and will detail the key phases for efficient game-based
    affect interaction.  Advanced deep learning methods for player experience
    modeling, game adaptation, procedural content generation, and computational
    game creativity will be showcased via a plethora of projects developed at
    the Institute of Digital Games, University of Malta (game.edu.mt).

#Syllabus 

* Session 1: Introduction to the domain of games. Why games are the ideal arena
  for AI and deep learning (DL)? What is there beyond gameplaying for AI/DL and
  why it is even more challenging? 
* Session 2: Deep learning for modeling players
* Session 3: Deep learning for generating content
