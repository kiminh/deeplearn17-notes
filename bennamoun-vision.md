1. what is computer vision
  * feature extraction and classification
  * why deep learning (engineered features vs learned features)
  * importance of sensing, high performance computing, and big data for deep
    learning
  * image understand and ultimate goal of computer vision.
2. Artificial Neural Networks basics: artificial neuron characteristics
   (activation function)
  * types of architectures (feed-forward networks vs.
      recurrent networks)
  * types of learning rules.
3. Feed-forward networks and their training: Single Layer Perceptron (SLP),
   Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), and back-propagation.
4. Deep learning and why training is difficult with more layers, and how to
   solve it (how to train and debug large-scale and deep multi-layer neural
   networsk).
5. Convolutional Neural Networks & variants (with tools & libraries), and their
   application to computer vision.
6. Auto-Encoders and their application to computer vision
