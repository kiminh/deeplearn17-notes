Initial first successful deployments in hyperscale internet services are now
driving broader commercial interest in adopting Deep learning as a design
principle for cognitive applications in the enterprise. In this class, we will
review hardware acceleration and co-optimized software frameworks for Deep
Learning, and discuss model development and deployment to accelerate adoption
of Deep Learning based solutions for enterprise deployments
