* Support Vector Machines SVM are a powerful methodology for solving problems
  in nonlinear classification, function estimation and density estimation 
* Least Squares Support Vector Machines (LS-SVM) are reformulations of the
  standard SVMs which lead to simplicity and performance by solving linear KKT
  systems, with strong application potentials.  LS-SVMs are 
  * closely related to regularization networks and Gaussian processes but
    additionally emphasize and exploit deeper insights and opportunities of
    primal-dual formulations. 
* Links between 
  * kernel versions of classical pattern recognition algorithms such as kernel
    Fisher discriminant analysis and 
  * extensions to unsupervised learning, recurrent networks and control are
    produced. 
* Robustness, sparseness and weightings can be incorporated into LS-SVMs.
* Recent developments are in kernel spectral clustering, data visualization and
  dimensionality reduction, and survival analysis. For very large scale
  problems a method of Fixed Size LS-SVM is proposed
* applications in our interdisciplinary research on medical diagnostics and
  time series predictions will be highlighted. The use of neural networks and
  LS SVM in deep learning will be presented.
