#Summary
The abundance of devices with cameras and numerous real-world application
scenarios for AI and autonomous robots create an increasing demand for
human-level visual perception of complex scenes. Hierarchical convolutional
neural networks have a long and successful history for learning pattern
recognition tasks in visual perception. They extract increasingly complex
features by local, convolutional computations, and create invariances to
transformations by pooling operations. In recent years, advances in parallel
computing, such as the use of programmable GPUs, the availability of large
annotated image and video data sets, and advances in deep learning methods
yielded dramatic progress in visual perception performance. The course will
cover motivations for deep convolutional networks from visual statistics and
visual cortex, feed-forward networks for image categorization, object
detection, and object-class segmentation, recurrent architectures for visual
perception, 3D perception, and spatial transformations in convolutional
networks. State-of-the-art examples from computer vision and robotics will be
used to illustrate the approaches.
