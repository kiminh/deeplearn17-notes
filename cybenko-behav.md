* human, natural and machine generated behaviors. This course will review a
  variety of behavior modeling approaches and provide a tutorial on classical,
  recurrent neural network and recurrent deep learning methods for learning
  behaviors. 
* Application areas will include social behaviors, computer systems behaviors
  for security purposes and as well as other domains.

#Syllabus

* Overview of behavior modeling and application domains
* Goals of and metrics for behavior learning
* Recurrent neural networks and long short term memory (LSTM)
* Software implementations and hands on exercises (TensorFlow, Keras)
* Comparisons with classical methods
