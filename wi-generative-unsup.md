* We shall focus on two classes of models, namely the undirected energy based
  models and the directed latent variable models, including the deep undirected
  and directed graphical models parametrized by convolutional neural networks.

#Syllabus

1. Markov random field models, maximum entropy and maximum likelihood.
2. Latent factor models including factor analysis, independent component
   analysis, sparse coding, matrix factorization; auto-encoder and embedding.
3. Deep undirected and directed models, maximum likelihood, contrastive
   divergence, variational, adversarial, and cooperative learning methods.

The focus will be on 3., with 1. and 2. laying the groundwork.
