The rest of lecture focuses on two key natural language understanding tasks:
* information extraction
  * Transforming unstructured text to structured databases
  * aims to find the entities and their relationships in text, as well as to
    make the extracted facts easily accessible programmatically
  * basic problem setting, such as binary relation extraction as sequence
    labeling problems. After that, we will emphasize more on the
  * latest distant supervision methods, which model the multi-sentence, n-ary
    relation settings using structured LSTM models. New approaches for
  * embedding entities and relations in a knowledge base for reasoning for
    previously unknown facts will also be covered.
* Question answering, while often used as the means to demonstrate machine
  intelligence, is an important application for fulfilling user's information
  need. In this part, we'll start by introducing the general framework of
  answering question using unstructured text, such as Wikipedia or the Web, and
  describe the current state-of-the-art deep learning approaches. We will also
  discuss how to leverage structured data such as databases or tables to answer
  questions, with the focus on semantic parsing methods.

Part 1 QA, deep learning
part 2 konwl base embed & info extract
part 3 sem pars & QA

## Intro

- the test of intelligence: QA
- categs of **early** QA syss (not just text-based)
- _object_ and _subject_

##KB-embed 

- tensor decomp
loss func is least sqs of $ v(Obama) \times R_bornIn \times v(hawai)^T $
- typed tensor decomp (Chang+ emnlp 14)
- Exper: KB completion

## KB augmented with textual relations

- Combine information from text and existing KB
- convolution 
- Toutanova+ emnlp 2015, acl 2016; Verga+ naacl 16

##Embed relation paths

Take multi-hop paths as input (e.g., [Guu+ 2015])
also RNN (Neelakantan+ 15) sum (Lin+ 15)
- problems
  - number of pathes grow exp in max length
    - prune or sample (Lao+ 11, Lin+ 15, Guu+ 15)
  - take nodes into account
- more compositions (Toutanova+ acl 16)

##KB-based QA

- Generic Sem Parsing Kwiatkowski+ 13
- SEMPRE \lambda-DCS  (Liang 2013)
  - DCS: dep based comp sem
  - Bridging (Berant+ emnlp 13) 
    - Which college did Obama go to? 
    - college and Obama is OK, but _go to_ is too difficult. 
      - Bridginig is a work-around
  - paraphrasing Berant & Liang acl 14
- CCG-graph Reddy+ tacl 14
- MT Bao+ acl 14
  - CYK-like algo
