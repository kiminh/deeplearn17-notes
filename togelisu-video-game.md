reasons for doing this
  * for game design and development, for example by automatically testing games
    or providing interesting adversaries, and for 
  * testing AI methods in realistic environments.  However, the applications of
    deep learning and other similar methods go beyond playing games, and into
    creating game content itself. This is challenging task for AI methods,
    which 
* has often been approached with search-based methods, but where a recent crop
  of machine learning-based approaches has recently appeared.
