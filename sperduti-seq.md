* With the diffusion of cheap sensors, sensor-equipped devices (e.g., drones),
  and sensor networks (such as Internet of Things), as well as the development
  of inexpensive human-machine interaction interfaces, the ability to quickly
  and effectively process sequential data is becoming more and more important.
* tasks 
  * monitoring and classification of human behavior to prediction of future
    events
* approaches 
  * linear models to early models of Recurrent Neural Networks, up to more
    recent Deep Learning solutions.
